# TE-Gastrulation

Hi Cyril and Evarist ! 
Could you please add the different code used in the following days in here.

# Evarist

- smb://lvg-bioinfo.epfl.ch/projects/jpontis/2008_scrnaseq_E-MTAB-9388//results_sfam 
Boxplot/UMAP/PseudoTime/CST of TE expression.
- smb://lvg-bioinfo.epfl.ch/projects/jpontis/2012_10x_GSE140021/results_noBatchCorr/figs/umap_4each_sfam
We only used the UMAP with TE and Gene visual.
- smb://lvg-bioinfo.epfl.ch/projects/jpontis/2104_10x_multiome_atacExpr
I only used filed generated cellranger analysis with same parameters than used by Bastien (default) and more recently with your bam file of atac-seq generated on the gex clusters.

# Cyril

In your case it gonna be temporary and only for reviewer now, no need to be ultra clean.
Furthermore, at the proof moment we will update with the repository of your choice, and put the link here instead.

# Cheers guys and thank again for your commitment into this journey.
